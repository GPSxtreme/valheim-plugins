# Description (Plus Version)
Add to your game the most beautiful and functional boats, in all there are 14 boats in the cargo, speed, fishing and war categories.</br>
The mod also contains, oil press, fish extract, cranes and props to help you explore this giant world.</br>
Now you can use the fish you catch to extract the Fish Extract using the Oil Press, the fish extract gives you strength to carry more weight (250kg).
Gather ten fishs and create the Fish Basket that is used in the oil press.</br>
Build the Carpenter Table to craft Resin Wood, Caulked Wood, Cloth Ship and ShipRope used in boat crafting recipes.</br>
Use the pier crane, fishing net, fish stand, totem poles, etc... to decorate your harbor.</br>
Use the Hercule Fishing Boat to fish, when sailing this boat at rowing speed, fish will start to appear in the front basket of the boat</br>
No time to fish? When building the fishing dock fish will start to look like they are inside a box.</br>
Are the winds not helping you? Wear the Wind Belt and the winds will always blow in your favor.</br>
`By pressing the LeftShift + O key combination, all tamed animals that are within a 20 meter radius of the player will be transported to the same place where the player is, this key combination is great for you to be able to board and disembark your animals on ships from OdinShipPlus.`

# Thanks

My sincere thanks to the entire OdinPlus team -  <i>@Azummat - @Blaxxun's - @JustAFrogger - @probablykory</i> and @Lunchbox for the 3D models and for appreciating my work.

A special thanks to my Professor <i>@GraveBear</i>, without his teachings and his encouragement I would never have gotten it.

I want to thank Archaeologist and 3D artist Alberto Foglia who donated one of his most beautiful models (Viking Longship - Skuldelev 2) to be used in our mod and further enrich our Viking world. Few people in the world have such a kind heart. Follow his wonderful work at the link below.
