# Foraging

Adds a foraging skill that increases the item yield while foraging and makes berries and mushrooms respawn faster.

Starting at skill level 30, you can see the time until pickables respawn.

Each level also slightly increases the radius at which pickables are picked.

All of this can be configured.

Can be installed on a server, to enforce the configuration.
